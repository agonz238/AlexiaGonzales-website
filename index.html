        <div class="subheading mb-5">Philosophy Major</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a second year college student majoring in Philosophy and headed towards Pre-Med.I currently attend the University of California, Riverside and hope to gain the knowledge and real life experiences to reach my dream of becoming a nurse practitioner.I am a diligent professional who has consistently been praised as proactive by my coworkers and management. Over the course of my 5 years of experience, I’ve developed a complex skill set. My experiences in customer service and communications, office environments and the medical field have helped me master a certain set of skills including communication, multitasking, critical thinking, and leadership in my work. I have consistently demonstrated these abilities in all my work and school experiences. I invite you to review my detailed achievements in this resume
<br><br>

        I am passionate about helping others, being involved, leadership, and creative projects. I enjoy helping others whether it's tutoring or mentoring and by job shadowing in the ER. I'm involved in many clubs on campus that include social, community service and environmental sustainability. I am part of many leadership programs such as UCR pathways and Latina Leadership programs. Lastly, I love to join or develop creative projects such as event management and community service projects.In the past I've worked in the food industry, at restaurants, dining halls and grocery stores. I've also had experience in public policy when I worked at a state senator's district office. I've had experience with medical facilities and sports medicine when I volunteered for the athletics program in high school and for the hospital. 
<br><br>

        I am interested in many different things, as they make up who I am today. One of the things I’m interested in is cultural awareness and anthropology. I not only enjoy learning about my own cultures, Chinese and Mexican, but I love to learn about others. Specifically, I love to understand the differences among cultural behaviors including religion, social norms, and their financial situations. ’Another thing I am interested in is sports and being a leader to my team. I do not just want to play because I love it, but I want to make my teammates love the game as much as I do whether in volleyball, basketball, or swim. I believe the best way to build social and create healthy habits around staying active is being a part of a sports team. A third thing I am interested in is creative opportunities. I like to keep in touch with my creative side, so I can get to know myself and what I like. One of the many events I have participated in  is helping set up a Gala dinner to honor three women for the organization Latina Leaders of Kern County. I also attended an art school for 3 years which helped me find my love for painting. These sorts of artistic and creative opportunities allow me to express myself and develop new ideas. Lastly, I am interested in environmental sustainability. I have joined clubs like the environmental club, so that I can be a part of keeping the environment clean and spreading the message of sustainability. These are the main things I have found to be passionate about and hope to further my experiences and involvement in the things I happen to love to do.
